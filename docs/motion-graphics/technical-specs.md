## Animation Style Guide

### UI Animation Principles
- **Timing**: Use easy-in-out easing for most transitions
- **Scale**: Elements should scale from 0.95 to 1.0 when appearing
- **Opacity**: Fade in elements starting at 0.7 opacity
- **Position**: Elements should move 15-20px when transitioning in

### Text Animation Guidelines
- **Entrance**: Text should fade in with slight upward movement
- **Emphasis**: Key points should pulse or highlight
- **Exit**: Text should fade out with slight downward movement
- **Timing**: Allow minimum 3 seconds for reading text blocks

### Brand-Specific Guidelines
- Primary color (#FF2E00) should be used for emphasis and calls-to-action
- Animations should reflect app responsiveness (quick, smooth)
- Dark mode aesthetic should be maintained throughout
- Include "custom scrollbar" animations to showcase app attention to detail

## Rendering Guidelines
- **Quality Settings**: Maximum quality for final render
- **Composition**: Pre-compose complex animations for better performance
- **Preview**: Test on multiple screen sizes before finalizing
- **Optimization**: Keep final file size under 100MB for web sharing
